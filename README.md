- ⚡ **Fun fact** I'm not just a tech enthusiast; I'm also a certified first aider ⛑️ and lifeguard🛟! Beyond diving into lines of code, I've honed my quick thinking and problem-solving skills through monitoring pools and ensuring safety.

It's all about diving in headfirst and making sure everyone stays afloat!
